Revision history for Perl extension CGI.

0.8  Thu Jul  5 11:31:26 2001
    Made the Package work with MakeMaker after using it as a private
    Module for some Months

0.8.1 Sat Jul 21 14:43 2001
    Renamed the Package from CGI::OO to CGI::XMLApplication, since that
    name makes more clear what it does :)
    
    As well I enabled the run function, to get a context hash as a
    parameter.
